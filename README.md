# Hey there, I‚Äôm **Mert Arcan**! ü§ñ

Passionate **AI Engineer** with a love for pushing the boundaries of machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven innovation. My journey started with a BSc in Computer Engineering (TED University) and an MSc in Engineering with Management (King‚Äôs College London). I‚Äôm currently focused on designing, training, and deploying advanced AI models ‚Äî from Transformers and GNNs to time-series forecasting networks.

- Building **AI solutions** from the ground up (data collection, cleaning, modeling, deployment)  
- Fine-tuning **cutting-edge architectures** (LLMs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs)  
- Integrating **MLOps** best practices for scalable, robust deployments  
- Fueled by continuous learning, a hands-on approach, and open collaboration  

I hold a UK Graduate Visa (valid until **January 2027**) and am open to relocation for **AI**, **ML**, or **Software Engineering** roles that tackle exciting, high-impact challenges. Let‚Äôs shape the future together!
